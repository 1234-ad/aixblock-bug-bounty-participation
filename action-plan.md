  - Include all required information
  - Reference forked repository

- [ ] **Pull Request Submission**
  - Create dedicated branch for fix
  - Implement security improvements
  - Reference original issue

## üéØ Target Vulnerabilities (Based on Historical Data)

### High-Probability Targets
1. **IDOR Vulnerabilities** - Previous $450 reward
2. **Stored XSS via File Upload** - Previous $200 reward  
3. **Authentication Bypass** - Previous $450 reward
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Previous findings
5. **Rate Limiting Bypass** - Previous findings

### New Attack Vectors to Explore
1. **Business Logic Flaws** in workflow automation
2. **Payment Processing Vulnerabilities**
3. **Web3 Integration Security Issues**
4. **MCP Layer Security Flaws**
5. **Advanced Persistent XSS**

## üí∞ Expected Reward Calculation

### Conservative Estimate (Minimum Expected)
- 2 Medium severity issues: $400 + 1,000 AXB tokens
- 1 High severity issue: $450 + 1,000 AXB tokens
- **Total**: $850 + 2,000 AXB tokens

### Optimistic Estimate (Target Goal)
- 1 Critical severity issue: $750 + 1,500 AXB tokens
- 2 High severity issues: $900 + 2,000 AXB tokens
- 3 Medium severity issues: $600 + 1,500 AXB tokens
- **Total**: $2,250 + 5,000 AXB tokens

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### Testing Constraints
- **No Service Disruption**: Avoid DoS/DDoS attacks
- **Owned Accounts Only**: Test with personal accounts
- **Responsible Disclosure**: No public disclosure until fixed
- **Professional Conduct**: Respectful engagement with team

### Backup Plans
- **Multiple Attack Vectors**: Don't rely on single vulnerability type
- **Diverse Severity Levels**: Target various CVSS ranges
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on high-impact, well-documented issues
- **Fix Implementation**: Always provide working solutions
