# AIxBlock Bug Bounty Participation

This repository documents my participation in the **AIxBlock Bug Bounty Program** - a comprehensive security research initiative targeting the AIxBlock decentralized AI platform.

## 🎯 Bounty Overview

- **Total Pool**: $10,000 USD + $30,000 worth of AXB tokens
- **Target Repository**: [AIxBlock-2023/awesome-ai-dev-platform-opensource](https://github.com/AIxBlock-2023/awesome-ai-dev-platform-opensource)
- **Deadline**: January 14, 2026
- **Scope**: Frontend, Backend, Blockchain components

## 🔍 Research Areas

### High-Priority Targets
